## Overview

This document outlines enhancement ideas and future vision for the PowerShell Testing Suite (PSTS) beyond the current Phase 1 implementation. These ideas range from immediate quick wins to revolutionary long-term features that could transform PSTS into an enterprise-grade PowerShell security platform.

## üöÄ **Immediate Enhancements (Phase 1.5)**

### **1. Expand Security Rule Coverage**

**Current State**: 4 core security rules implemented
**Enhancement Goal**: Add 10+ critical security rules for comprehensive coverage

#### **New Security Rules to Implement**

##### **Network Security Rules**

- **InsecureHTTP**: Detect unencrypted HTTP requests in `Invoke-RestMethod`, `Invoke-WebRequest`
- **WeakTLS**: Identify dangerous TLS/SSL settings and protocol downgrades

##### **Registry Security Rules**

- **DangerousRegistryMods**: Unsafe registry modifications (security settings, startup)
- **RegistryCredentials**: Credentials stored in registry keys
- **PrivilegedRegistryAccess**: Unnecessary privileged registry operations

##### **PowerShell Specific Rules** üéØ **TOP PRIORITY**

- ‚úÖ **ExecutionPolicyBypass**: Detect execution policy bypass attempts (`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`)
- ‚úÖ **ScriptBlockLogging**: Missing security logging configuration (`$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference = 'None'`)
- ‚úÖ **UnsafePSRemoting**: Insecure PowerShell remoting configurations (`Enable-PSRemoting -Force`, unencrypted sessions)
- ‚úÖ **DangerousModules**: Usage of potentially dangerous modules without validation (`Import-Module` with untrusted sources)
- ‚úÖ **PowerShellVersionDowngrade**: Detection of PowerShell v2 usage (`powershell.exe -version 2`)
- ‚úÖ **UnsafeDeserialization**: Unsafe XML/CLIXML deserialization (`Import-Clixml` from untrusted sources)
- ‚úÖ **PrivilegeEscalation**: Attempts to elevate privileges (`Start-Process -Verb RunAs` without validation)
- ‚úÖ **ScriptInjection**: Dynamic script generation vulnerabilities (`New-Module`, `Add-Type` with user input)
- ‚úÖ **UnsafeReflection**: Unsafe .NET reflection usage (`[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom()`)
- ‚úÖ **PowerShellConstrainedMode**: Scripts that may break in constrained language mode
- ‚úÖ **UnsafeFileInclusion**: Dot-sourcing untrusted scripts (`. $userInput`)
- ‚úÖ **PowerShellWebRequests**: Unvalidated web requests (`Invoke-WebRequest` without certificate validation)

##### **Data Security Rules**

- **SQLInjection**: Unsafe database query construction
- **LDAPInjection**: Unsafe directory service queries
- **XMLSecurity**: XXE vulnerabilities and unsafe XML parsing
- **LogInjection**: Unsafe logging that could lead to log injection

**Implementation Priority**: **CRITICAL** (PowerShell-first approach - expand from 4 to 12+ PowerShell-specific rules first)
**Effort Estimate**: (focus on PowerShell expertise)
**Impact**: **VERY HIGH** - establishes PSTS as the definitive PowerShell security platform

### **Recommended Implementation Order:**

- ‚úÖ #### **üéØ Phase 1.5A: PowerShell-Specific Rules**

- Focus on the additional PowerShell-specific rules above.

[PowerShell-Specific Rules](https://github.com/J-Ellette/PowerShellTestingSuite/blob/main/buildplans/copilot_phase_1_ideas.md#powershell-specific-rules--top-priority)
These provide:

- ‚úÖ **Unique value proposition** in the market
- ‚úÖ **Deep PowerShell expertise** demonstration  
- ‚úÖ **High-impact security coverage** for PowerShell environments
- ‚úÖ **Strong foundation** for enterprise PowerShell security

#### **üåê Phase 1.5B: General Security Rules**  

Then add the broader security rules:

- [Network Security (HTTP/TLS rules)](https://github.com/J-Ellette/PowerShellTestingSuite/edit/main/buildplans/copilot_phase_1_ideas.md#network-security-rules)
- [File System Security](https://github.com/J-Ellette/PowerShellTestingSuite/edit/main/buildplans/copilot_phase_1_ideas.md#file-system-security-rules)
- [Registry Security](https://github.com/J-Ellette/PowerShellTestingSuite/edit/main/buildplans/copilot_phase_1_ideas.md#registry-security-rules)
- [Data Security (SQL/LDAP injection)](https://https://github.com/J-Ellette/PowerShellTestingSuite/edit/main/buildplans/copilot_phase_1_ideas.md#data-security-rules)

**PowerShell-First?**

1. **Market Position**: Become THE PowerShell security tool
2. **Expertise Depth**: Show deep understanding of PowerShell risks
3. **Enterprise Appeal**: PowerShell is critical in enterprise environments
4. **Unique Differentiation**: Most security tools are generic - you'd be PowerShell-specialized

---

## üéØ **Strategic Analysis: PowerShell-First vs. General Security**

### **PowerShell-Specific Advantages:**

#### **Market Opportunity**

- **Underserved niche**: No comprehensive PowerShell-only security tools exist
- **Enterprise demand**: PowerShell is ubiquitous in Windows enterprise environments
- **Attack vector reality**: PowerShell is heavily used in real-world attacks (Living off the Land)
- **Compliance need**: Many frameworks now require PowerShell-specific security controls

#### **Technical Advantages**

- **AST-based analysis**: PowerShell's rich AST enables deeper analysis than generic tools
- **Language expertise**: Deep PowerShell knowledge creates better rules and fixes
- **Contextual understanding**: PowerShell-specific patterns vs. generic code patterns
- **Fix quality**: PowerShell-aware fixes are more accurate and useful

#### **Examples of PowerShell-Unique Risks:**

```powershell
# PowerShell v2 downgrade attack (bypasses many security controls)
powershell.exe -version 2 -command "malicious code"

# Constrained Language Mode bypass
[scriptblock]::Create('malicious code').Invoke()

# PowerShell remoting without encryption
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName target -UseSSL:$false

# Dynamic module loading attack
Import-Module ([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String("base64_payload")))
```

### **General Security Rules Value:**

- **Broader applicability**: Apply to any language/platform
